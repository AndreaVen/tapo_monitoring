#Tapo Monitoring
##This project shows a disgustingly simple html page with the energy consumptions of all my Tapo P110 outlets.

The tapo App has no way to have comprehensive informations of all the outlets at once (e.g total power to know if your breaker is going to pop) and this repo tries to fix that.
